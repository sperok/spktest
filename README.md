# Svelte Headless
Example site showing how to create a simple blog site that plugs into a headless CMS so you don't have to do all that admin-side coding.

## Ultra-fast, super simple free headless blog made with Svelte and Pushnote.
- The code from this site comes from our github repo [https://github.com/webuildsociety/svelte-headless](https://github.com/webuildsociety/svelte-headless).
- The content of this site comes from [https://pullnote.com](pullnote.com).

This site took less than an hour to create from start to finish, including registering the domain and setting up hosting (at vercel.com). Downloading it as a skeleton you could probably get the whole process complete in less.

Have fun!
